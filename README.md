# odin-recipes

My first simple project with HTML on "The Odin Project"
<p>It is a simple recipe website.</p>

I have put into practice my basic HTML knowledge which I have recently learnt:
<ul>
    <li>Images</li>
    <li>Links</li>
    <li>Paragraphs</li>
    <li>Lists</li>
    <li>Headings</li>
    <li>Text</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Will be updated later when I gain some knowledge with CSS</em></p>

<p>Update:</p>
<p>Added some basic CSS</p>
